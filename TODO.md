* check external links?
* add LTL specs support
* detect changes using mutation observers?

# ideas

* concurrent testing with:
    * multiple independent browsers
    * multiple tabs in a single browser
* faults:
    * paused/blurred tab
    * network request reordering, delays, etc (not necessary with antithesis fault injector?)
    * clear cookies, application state, etc
