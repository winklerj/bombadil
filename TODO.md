    * instrument inline scripts in html?
        * see riotjs example in todomvc!
    * cache instrumented responses
        * respect cache headers? or just infinite lifetime? probably needs to
          respect because there _could_ be dynamically generated scripts, even
          if weird.
    * rewrite/produce sourcemaps (or at least drop the directives from
      instrumented sources, as they'll be incorrect

# ideas

* concurrent testing with:
    * multiple independent browsers
    * multiple tabs in a single browser
* faults:
    * paused/blurred tab
    * network request reordering, delays, etc (not necessary with antithesis fault injector?)
    * clear cookies, application state, etc
