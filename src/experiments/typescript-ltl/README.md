# Specification Language

This is a sketch of a specification language for Bombadil, using TypeScript or
JavaScript modules. So far it's not integrated, only a lone experiment to try
out different designs.

## Tests

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test . 
```
