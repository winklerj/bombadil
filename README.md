# Bombadil

Property-based testing for web UIs, autonomously exploring and validating
correctness properties, *finding harder bugs earlier*.

Runs in your local developer environment, in CI, and inside Antithesis.

*NOTE: Bombadil is new and experimental. Stuff is going to change in the early
days, and generally stuff will be missing. Even so, we hope you'll try it out!*

## How it works (or, will work!)

As a user, you:

* **Write a specification:**

    A specification is a TypeScript module that exports *actions* and *properties*.

    Actions are what drives a test forward. You reexport the actions from the
    `bombadil` framework you want and, optionally, you define and export custom
    actions (e.g. "triple-click this div"). The bulk of actions should be
    provided by Bombadil itself.

    *NOTE: the support for actions is not ready yet!*

    Properties are linear temporal logic formulas, describing what the system under
    test should and shouldn't do. Like the actions, the `bombadil` framework provides
    a set of reasonable properties for web applications. You may also specify your
    own domain-specific requirements.

* **Run tests:**

    When you have a specification, you run tests against a URL using that
    specification. This can be done locally, or in something like GitHub Actions.

This is unlike Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright, where you write fixed test
cases. Instead, you define actions and properties, and Bombadil explores and
tests your web application for you. This is *property-based testing* or
*fuzzing* for web applications.

Again, the description above is partly aspirational. We're building in the
open, so stay tuned!

## Usage

Start a test:

```bash
bombadil test https://example.com
```

Or headless (useful in CI):

```bash
bombadil test https://example.com --headless
```

Check custom properties defined in a specification file:

```bash
bombadil test https://example.com my-spec.ts
```

These will log any property violations they find. If you want to immediately
exit, for instance when running in CI, run with `--exit-on-violation`:

```bash
bombadil test --exit-on-violation https://example.com my-spec.ts
```

## Install

So far there's not a lot options for installing Bombadil other than using Nix.
That's going to change though! We want to supply:

* statically linked executables, which you can just download 
* Docker images
* a GitHub Action, ready to be used in your CI configuration

But for now, your best bet is either running it through Nix, like:

```
nix run github:antithesishq/bombadil
```

Or setting up the [developer environment](docs/contributing.md) and compiling
it with Cargo:

```
nix develop
cargo build --release
```
